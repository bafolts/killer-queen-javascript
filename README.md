The killer queen arcade game changed my life. I want to play it in a browser with my friends.

Feel free to contribute. I try to spend a half hour to an hour a day doing something.

# controls

This is a 1-10 player game. For the time being you will need 10 USB gamepads connected to a device to play. As you connect gamepads and press buttons a corresponding player will become active. The joystick will move the character. To jump or fly you can press any button on the gamepad.
